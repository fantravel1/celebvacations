        <h2>Travel Profile</h2>
        <p>Mariah Carey, the five-octave voice behind "All I Want for Christmas Is You," brings her signature glamour to every vacation. Known for never being photographed in unflattering circumstances, her travel style is unapologetically luxurious and theatrical.</p>
        <p>Her annual Aspen Christmas tradition has become pop culture legend—footage of Mariah in the snow, in stilettos, sipping champagne has defined her holiday persona. She's equally drawn to summer Mediterranean escapes and exclusive Caribbean retreats.</p>
