        <h2>Travel Profile</h2>
        <p>Tom Hiddleston, the RADA-trained British actor best known for playing Loki in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, maintains a notably private profile despite his global fame. Unlike many Hollywood stars, he avoids flashy vacation destinations and paparazzi-heavy spots.</p>
        <p>His travel is often work-related, tied to filming locations and press tours. When he does vacation, he tends toward cultural destinations and quiet retreats, befitting his Cambridge-educated, theater-trained background. His 2016 relationship with Taylor Swift briefly put him in the tabloid spotlight, but he's since returned to a more private travel style.</p>
