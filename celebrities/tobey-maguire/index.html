        <h2>Travel Profile</h2>
        <p>Tobey Maguire, who defined Spider-Man for a generation and recently returned to the role in "No Way Home," maintains one of the lower profiles among A-list actors. His longtime friendship with Leonardo DiCaprio means they're often spotted together at the same destinations.</p>
        <p>Unlike DiCaprio's more visible travel, Tobey tends to stay under the radar. He's known for his poker skills and low-key lifestyle, choosing quality time over flashy displays. When he does appear publicly, it's often at film festivals or in the company of his famous friend group.</p>
