                    <p class="lead">Chateau Marmont isn't just a hotel—it's a monument to Hollywood mythology, a time capsule of scandal and glamour, a place where the boundaries between public and private life have been negotiated for nearly a century. Perched above Sunset Boulevard like a Gothic Revival castle transplanted from the Loire Valley, it has sheltered, inspired, and occasionally scandalized the entertainment industry since 1929.</p>
                    <p>The Chateau's appeal lies in its contradictions: a very public hotel that offers extreme privacy; a glamorous destination for those seeking to escape glamour; an establishment that maintains standards while tolerating behavior other hotels wouldn't abide. Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn captured this duality perfectly when he advised starlets: "If you must get in trouble, do it at the Chateau Marmont." That advice still resonates—the Chateau remains Hollywood's sanctuary for bad behavior and quiet recuperation alike, where stars can be human without fear of exposure.</p>

                <div class="feature-highlight">
                    <p>The Chateau rises above Sunset Boulevard on a hillside lot that provides both visibility and seclusion—you can see the hotel from the Strip, but once inside the gates, you've entered another world. The main building, a seven-story Gothic Revival château, anchors the property. Spread across the hillside gardens behind it are individual bungalows and cottages, each with private entrances and walled patios. This layout is key to the hotel's discretion: celebrities in bungalows can come and go without ever entering the main building or crossing paths with other guests.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid grid-2">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>The Château Building</h3>
                        <p>The main building houses hotel rooms, suites, and penthouses across seven floors. The lobby is intentionally intimate—no grand statements, just a living room atmosphere where regulars recognize each other. The penthouse suites offer panoramic views of Los Angeles, from the Hollywood sign to the Pacific Ocean on clear days.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>The Gardens</h3>
                        <p>Behind the château, lush gardens hide bungalows and cottages scattered across the hillside. Winding pathways connect these private retreats to the main building, but many guests prefer to remain hidden in their own domains. The gardens also house the famous pool and poolside restaurant, the social center of the property.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Accommodations</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">No two rooms at the Chateau are alike. The hotel embraces quirks and character over cookie-cutter consistency. Each space has its own personality, its own history, its own ghosts.</p>

                <div class="suite-feature">
                    <h3>The Bungalows</h3>

                        <p class="suite-price">From $3,000 per night</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The Chateau's bungalows are the ultimate celebrity accommodation—standalone cottages hidden in the gardens with completely private entrances and walled patios. Celebrities can arrive by car directly to their bungalow, never setting foot in the main building. Many have full kitchens and living rooms, making them suitable for extended stays. Bungalow 3, where John Belushi died in 1982, remains the property's most requested (and most notorious) accommodation—a testament to the entertainment industry's complicated relationship with its own mythology.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="suite-feature">

                    </div>
                    <p>The top-floor suites in the main building offer sweeping views across Los Angeles—the Hollywood Hills, downtown, and on clear days, the ocean. These suites combine the romance of the château architecture with the convenience of the main building. Several have been meticulously restored to their original 1920s character while others embrace a more contemporary aesthetic.</p>

                        <p>Larger than bungalows, the cottages suit families or those planning extended stays. Full kitchens, separate living areas, and private outdoor spaces create home-away-from-home comfort. Many celebrities have lived in cottages for months during film productions.</p>

                    <h3>The Legends</h3>
                    <p>The Chateau's history is inseparable from Hollywood's Golden Age and beyond. Greta Garbo lived here while fleeing the spotlight. Howard Hughes reportedly conducted surveillance on guests from his suite. James Dean and Natalie Wood worked on their "Rebel Without a Cause" lines by the pool. Jim Morrison lived in Room 32 and allegedly dangled from his balcony over Sunset Boulevard. John Belushi died in Bungalow 3 in 1982 after a night with drugs and the woman who supplied them. Hunter S. Thompson wrote and raved here. The walls have absorbed nearly a century of Hollywood's triumphs, tragedies, and everything in between.</p>

                        <p>The poolside restaurant is the Chateau's social center—a place to see and be seen (or, more accurately, to see and pretend not to see). The California-Mediterranean menu is almost beside the point; the restaurant's real purpose is as a gathering place for industry insiders. Breakfast meetings, lunch deals, dinner celebrations—the restaurant has witnessed them all. The outdoor setting, surrounded by the hotel's lush gardens, creates an atmosphere of cultivated casualness.</p>

                        <p>The darker, more intimate counterpart to the sunny poolside restaurant. Bar Marmont has hosted countless late-night encounters, clandestine meetings, and the kind of conversations that only happen after midnight. The lighting is dim, the cocktails are strong, and the discretion is absolute. It's the bar where deals close, relationships begin (or end), and Hollywood's after-hours culture thrives.</p>

                    <p>For those seeking complete seclusion, the Chateau offers 24-hour room service and private dining in bungalows and cottages. Many celebrity guests never visit the restaurant at all, preferring to have meals delivered to their private retreats. The kitchen accommodates dietary restrictions, last-minute requests, and the kind of specific demands that only celebrities make.</p>

                    <p>The Chateau's pool is perhaps the most photographed (and most carefully protected from photography) pool in Hollywood. Surrounded by lush gardens and shielded from the outside world, it's where celebrities actually swim, sunbathe, and socialize. The pool deck has witnessed countless movie deals, industry gossip sessions, and romantic encounters. Unlike hotel pools that exist primarily as amenities, the Chateau's pool functions as a genuine gathering place—a salon in swimwear.</p>

                        <p>On sunny afternoons, the pool deck becomes an informal industry gathering. Agents, actors, directors, and writers mingle in a setting that encourages casual interaction. The Chateau's membership model means everyone by the pool is either an industry insider or connected to one—no tourists, no autograph seekers, no intrusions.</p>

                        <h3>Privacy Policies</h3>
                        <p>Photography is strictly prohibited. Staff enforce this rule rigorously—guests caught taking unauthorized photos face immediate removal. This policy, more than any other, explains why celebrities feel comfortable at the pool. They can actually relax, knowing their candid moments won't end up online.</p>

                        <p>Built in 1929 by attorney Fred Horowitz, the Chateau was designed as luxury apartments modeled after the Château d'Amboise in France's Loire Valley. The timing couldn't have been worse—the stock market crashed months after completion. In 1931, with apartments sitting empty, the building converted to a hotel. This accidental origin proved fortunate: the apartment-style layouts created the spacious, kitchen-equipped rooms that would later attract long-term celebrity residents.</p>

                        <p>Word spread quickly through the studios: the Chateau offered privacy other hotels couldn't match. The separate entrances, the garden bungalows, the staff who didn't recognize (or pretended not to recognize) famous faces—it became the place for stars to conduct private lives away from public scrutiny. Greta Garbo's extended residencies set the template: complete seclusion without leaving Hollywood.</p>

John Belushi's fatal overdose in Bungalow 3 in 1982. The hotel became associated with excess, with a tolerance for behavior that would get guests banned elsewhere. This reputation, paradoxically, enhanced its appeal—celebrities knew the Chateau would keep their secrets.</p>

In 2020, Balazs converted the property to a members-only club and hotel, the ultimate expression of its insider status. Membership is curated; the waiting list is long. The transformation ensured the Chateau would remain a sanctuary for those who belong, not a destination for those who merely aspire.</p>

                        <p>Three factors make Chateau Marmont legendary: discretion (staff famously never talk), architecture (the bungalows and cottages provide complete privacy with separate entrances), and history (nearly a century of Hollywood association makes it sacred ground for the entertainment industry). It's the rare hotel where celebrities can truly let their guard down.</p>
