                    <p class="lead">The Little Nell isn't just Aspen's best hotel—it's the only address that matters for celebrities who take their skiing seriously. Positioned at the exact spot where Aspen Mountain meets the town, the hotel offers something no other five-star property can: step out your door, click into your bindings, and you're on the slopes.</p>
                    <p>Since opening in 1989, The Little Nell has defined luxury ski hospitality. The hotel combines the warmth of a mountain lodge with the sophistication of an urban boutique property. Belgian linens, gas fireplaces, marble bathrooms with heated floors, and mountain views from every room create a cocoon of comfort after days carving up Ajax (as locals call Aspen Mountain). But it's the service—a ski concierge who warms your boots overnight, a sommelier with 20,000 bottles at his disposal, a kitchen that earned Aspen its only Forbes Five-Star restaurant—that keeps A-listers returning season after season.</p>

                <div class="feature-highlight">
                    <p>The Little Nell occupies perhaps the most valuable piece of real estate in American skiing. The hotel sits at the base of the Silver Queen Gondola, directly at the bottom of Aspen Mountain's 3,267 vertical feet. To the left: the slopes. To the right: the restaurants, galleries, and boutiques of downtown Aspen. The location eliminates the friction that plagues most ski vacations—no shuttles, no parking hassles, no gear schleping across parking lots.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Ski Access</h3>
                        <p>True ski-in/ski-out means exactly that: ski down Spar Gulch and glide to within steps of the hotel entrance. In the morning, the Silver Queen Gondola—Aspen Mountain's main lift—is a 30-second walk from the lobby. No other five-star hotel in Aspen offers this.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Town Access</h3>
                        <p>Downtown Aspen begins at the hotel's front door. The Wheeler Opera House, high-end shopping on Galena Street, and Aspen's best restaurants are all within a 5-minute walk. During Food & Wine Classic weekend, the action literally surrounds the hotel.</p>

                    <p>Between December 20 and January 3, The Little Nell becomes Hollywood's unofficial satellite office. Studio executives, A-list actors, and industry power players converge on Aspen, with The Little Nell serving as the social hub. Element 47 reservations become impossible to secure, and the lobby bar hosts more dealmaking than most agency offices. This tradition dates to the 1990s and shows no signs of slowing.</p>

The kitchen focuses on contemporary American cuisine with Colorado influences—elk, trout, locally foraged ingredients. But the real star is the wine program: over 20,000 bottles and one of America's most awarded sommeliers.</p>

The Little Nell Mine was one of many that dotted Aspen Mountain in the 1880s. When the hotel opened in 1989, it reclaimed this name as a tribute to the town's history.</p>
