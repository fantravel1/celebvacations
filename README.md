## 🧠 Core Philosophy

CelebVacations is **not a blog**.  
It is a **structured travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- expand destination coverage
- infer patterns (clearly labeled)
- translate content
- generate summaries & rankings

Humans are required to:
- verify evidence
- approve confidence tiers
- enforce ethical boundaries
- prevent speculation drift

---
