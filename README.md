## 🧠 Core Philosophy

CelebVacations is **not a blog**.  
It is a **structured travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- expand destination coverage
- infer patterns (clearly labeled)
- translate content
- generate summaries & rankings

Humans are required to:
- verify evidence
- approve confidence tiers
- enforce ethical boundaries
- prevent speculation drift

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

CelebVacations is built around **repeatable entity types**.

### Core Entities
- Destination
- Celebrity
- Hotel / Resort
- Vacation Trip
- Travel Theme
- Seasonality Pattern
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links to related entities
- is programmatically generatable
